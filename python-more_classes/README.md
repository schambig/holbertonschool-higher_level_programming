## Description<!--@schambig-->

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language, it has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

This project is about Object Oriented Programming `OOP` and its two main aspects, classes and objects.

After this project I was able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/):

* What is OOP
* “first-class everything”
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
* What is `self`
* What is a method
* What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
* What are the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them
* What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`
* What is a class attribute
* What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
* What is a class method
* What is a static method
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the `getattr` function

## Resources<!--@schambig-->

Important concepts to help you understand this project:

* [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
* [Class and Instance Attributes](https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php)
* [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M) (Corey Schafer video)
* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”) 
* [str vs repr](https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)
