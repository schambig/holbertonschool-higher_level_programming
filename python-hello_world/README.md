## Description


After this project I was able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/):

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the [Zen of Python](#zen-of-python)
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using `print`
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Zen of Python

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```


## File structure

This table contains a brief description of the working files of the project, click on the names to get the source code.

* All these files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All these source code use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
