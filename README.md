## Description<!--@schambig-->

Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also 
help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web applications, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.

One of the most important reasons that makes Python a really good choice is its community. Community is essential to programmers because programming isn’t a solitary pursuit.

Here are **some** of the reasons why Python is such an awesome language, Python is:

* **Interpreted**, Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. i.e you do not need to compile your program before executing it.
* **Interactive**, You can interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.
* **Portable**, It can run on wide range of hardware Platforms.  
* **bject-Oriented**, Python supports Object-Oriented style and Procedural Paradigms.
* Used as a **scripting language** or can be **compiled** to byte-code for building large applications.
* It has **simple structure**, and a clearly defined syntax.
* Source code is comparatively easy-to-maintain.
* Has a huge collection of standard library.
